[Places based on misaligned pointers](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html#places-based-on-misaligned-pointers)

- A place is said to be 

"based on a misaligned pointer" 

if the last * projection 

during place computation 

was performed on a pointer 

that was not aligned for its type. 

- (If there is no * projection

in the place expression, 

then this is accessing the field of a local 

and rustc will guarantee proper alignment. 

- If there are multiple * projection,

then each of them incurs a load of the pointer-to-be-dereferenced itself from memory, 

and each of these loads is subject to the alignment constraint. 

- Note that some * projections
  
can be omitted in surface Rust syntax 

due to automatic dereferencing; 

we are considering the fully expanded place expression here.)

<br><br>

For instance, 

if ptr has type *const S 

where S has an alignment of 8, 

then ptr must be 8-aligned 

or else 

(*ptr).f 

is 

"based on an misaligned pointer". 

- This is true even if the type of the field f is

u8 (i.e., a type with alignment 1). 

In other words, 

the alignment requirement derives from 

the type of the pointer 

that was dereferenced, 

not 

the type of the field 

that is being accessed.
