[Back to 35-Tutorial-HashSet-continued-onwards.md](/documentation/35-Tutorial-HashSet-continued-onwards.md)

An iterator in Rust is responsible for creating a sequence of values and allows us to iterate over each item of the sequence. It is primarily used for looping and we can only loop over iterators in Rust.

Let's look at a simple example on how we can loop through an array.

```rust
let numbers = [2, 1, 17, 99, 34, 56];
```
