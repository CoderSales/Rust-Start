## Categories of Integer Data Types in Rust

Depending on the size of data, we can further classify the signed and unsigned integer type into various categories:

| Size	| Signed	| Unsigned  |

_________________________________

| 8-bit	| i8	    | u8        |

| 16-bit	| i16	| u16       |

| 32-bit	| i32	| u32       |

| 64-bit	| i64	| u64       |

| 128-bit	| i128	| u128      |
