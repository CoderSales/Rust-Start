[core - Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/index.html)

memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, bcmp, strlen 

- These are core memory routines which are generated by Rust codegen backends.

- Additionally,

- this library can make explicit calls to strlen.

- Their signatures are the same as found in C,

- but there are extra assumptions about their semantics:

- For memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, and bcmp, if the n parameter is 0,

- the function is assumed to not be UB,

- even if the pointers are NULL or dangling.

- (Note that making extra assumptions about these functions is common among compilers:

- clang and GCC do the same.)

- These functions are often provided by the system libc,

- but can also be provided by the compiler-builtins crate.

- Note that the library does not guarantee that it will always make these assumptions,

- so Rust user code directly calling the C functions should follow the C specification!

- The advice for Rust user code is to call the functions provided by this library instead

- (such as ptr::copy).
