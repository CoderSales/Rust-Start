memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, bcmp, strlen 

- core memory routines which are generated by Rust codegen backends.

- library can make explicit calls to strlen.

- Their signatures are the same as found in C,

- but there are extra assumptions about their semantics:

- For memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, and bcmp, if the n parameter is 0,

  - the function is assumed to not be UB, (continued after Aside below)

- memcpy, memmove, memset, memcmp, and bcmp (note continued) :

  - even if the pointers are NULL or dangling.

  - (extra assumptions about these functions is common among compilers:

  - clang and GCC do the same.)

  - These functions are often provided by the system libc,

  - but can also be provided by the compiler-builtins crate.

- Note that the library does not guarantee that it will always make these assumptions,

- so Rust user code directly calling the C functions should follow the C specification!

- The advice for Rust user code is to call the functions provided by this library instead

- (such as

```rust
ptr::copy
```

).
